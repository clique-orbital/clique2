### The idea
Many of our group chats we create involve some form of event that will be planned in the future. Be it your group project :file_folder: where you will have frequent meetings, or simply your **clique** of best friends :two_women_holding_hands::two_men_holding_hands: that will hang out all the time, there are many a times where your plans :date: are buried deep in a heap of messages :envelope:. Clique aims to integrate the experience of group chats and calendars, to help better event planning and ensure that you never miss an event again!
