## 1. Introduction

Clique is a messaging-cum-calendar mobile app for the masses. The main focus of the app is group calendars, where your group chats have their own personalized calendar for members to get in sync with the group events! Many of our group chats we create involve some form of event that will be planned in the future. Be it your group project where you will have frequent meetings, or simply your __clique__ of best friends that will hang out all the time, there are many a times where your plans are buried deep in a heap of messages. Clique aims to integrate the experience of group chats and calendars, to help better event planning and ensure that you never miss an event again!
